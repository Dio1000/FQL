-- This is how you declare a schema. --
schema: School

-/ This is the first way to declare a relation,
You can first declare the relation and the schema it belongs to. -/

relation: Student -> School
relation: StudentInfo -> School

-- Then you add the attributes in the relation. --
relation: Student -> {
    CNP, varchar(13)
    Name, varchar(20), nullable
    Surname, varchar(20), nullable
    Age, int, nullable
}

-/ This is the second way to declare a relation,
declaring both the attributes and the schema it belongs to simultaneously -/

relation: Teacher -> {
    CNP, varchar(13)
    Name, varchar(20), nullable
    Surname, varchar(20), nullable
    Age, int, nullable
    Course, varchar(20), nullable
} -> School
